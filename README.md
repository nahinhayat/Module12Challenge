Module 12 Challenge

Description:

The purpose of this analysis was to take historical data of healthy and high-risk loans that have already been issued and create a Logitic Regression model to predict if a borrower has the credit worthiness to be considered high-risk or low-risk. This was done by splitting the data into training and testing sets and using the model-fit-predict-evaluate pattern. The data was also resanpled via oversampling and was run through the same process.

Details:

The first step to creating the model is to split the data into Training and Testing sets:

Then a logistic regression model was created, fit, and used to predict:

A second model is created with resampled data and also evaluated:
